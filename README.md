# ME5463_Project
This is the code library for the final project of Spring 2020 ME 5463. 
This project explores two motion planning algorithms, potential field and A *. 
The Gazebo simulator was utilized to simulate motions in 3D. 

Install Instruction:
1. Open a terminal. 
2. Enter the below command.
mkdir me5463_ws/src
cd ~/me5463_ws/src
git clone https://github.com/caffreyu/icra_ros_simu.git turtlebot3_simulations
cd turtlebot3_simulations
git checkout ME5463_Project
cd ..
git clone https://github.com/caffreyu/icra_ros_love_cannot_speak.git turtlebot3
cd ..
git clone https://github.com/ROBOTIS-GIT/turtlebot3_msgs.git
cd ../..
catkin_make
echo 'source ~/me5463_ws/devel/setup.bash' >> ~/.bashrc 

To launch the gazebo simulator:
roslaunch turtlebot3_gazebo me5463_project.launch

To show the path generated by A* algorithm:
roslaunch robot_teleop autonomous_teleop.launch

The whole modifications for the turtlebot3 platform were finished in two days. 
More optimizations are needed and will be added for better performance. 
Please try running the above files at your own risk.
