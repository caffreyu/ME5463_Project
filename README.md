# ME5463_Project
This is the code library for the final project of Spring 2020 ME 5463. 
This project explores two motion planning algorithms, potential field and A *. 
The Gazebo simulator was utilized to simulate motions in 3D. 

Install Instruction:
1. Open a terminal. <br />
2. Enter the below command.<br />
mkdir me5463_ws/src <br />
cd ~/me5463_ws/src <br />
git clone https://github.com/caffreyu/icra_ros_simu.git turtlebot3_simulations <br />
cd turtlebot3_simulations<br />
git checkout ME5463_Project<br />
cd ..<br />
git clone https://github.com/caffreyu/icra_ros_love_cannot_speak.git turtlebot3<br />
cd ..<br />
git clone https://github.com/ROBOTIS-GIT/turtlebot3_msgs.git<br />
cd ../..<br />
catkin_make<br />
echo 'source ~/me5463_ws/devel/setup.bash' >> ~/.bashrc<br />

To launch the gazebo simulator:<br />
   roslaunch turtlebot3_gazebo me5463_project.launch<br />

To show the path generated by A* algorithm:<br />
   roslaunch robot_teleop autonomous_teleop.launch<br />

The whole modifications for the turtlebot3 platform were finished in two days. 
More optimizations are needed and will be added for better performance. <br />
